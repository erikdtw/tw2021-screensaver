In the summer of 2021 Thoughtworks refreshed its brand. This screen saver animates one of the many beautiful illustrations that were created as part of the brand refresh.


## Download and Installation

Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/thoughtworks/tw2021-screensaver/releases) and download the `Thoughtworks2021.saver.zip` file. If your web browser doesn't do it automatically, open the file you just downloaded. Then double-click on the `Thoughtworks2021.saver` file to install the screen saver. After it is installed you can select the saver in then System Preferences app. 

The screen saver does not check whether updates are available. So, you might want to go back to the releases page every couple of months.
